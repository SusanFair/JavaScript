## Overview of Project   Explain the purpose of this analysis.
The JavaScript and UFOs project is designed to illustrate the use of a multi-filtered table rendering data retrieved fromthe the ???? website.  This table will allow mutiple variables to be entered in the filter such as City, State and even the Shape of the UFO!!!  This project was also an exploration into the power of JavaScript and HTML in making a user friendly, interactive webpage.  

The UFO sightings data that was used for this project is from 2010 and reaches across the United States and Canada.

## Results
The results were multifold ... firstly one result was a great looking webpage!!

On this site at the beginning a full set of data is available.  To make the data more user friendly 5 Filters are provided un the 'Filter Search' title.  The filters include:
* Date
* City
* State/Province
* Country
* Shape

### How it Works.
The user can enter any viable entry into any field.  For example if 'ca' is entered into the state field.  A fill list of sightings in that state of California.

To drill down further a city filter could be added.  Dana may notice that el cajon is listeded several times.  Entering 'el cajon' into the City filter will return all of the sightings in El Cajon, California.

If the user wanted to understand the prevelence of a specific type of UFO the say want to start their filtering on the Shape of the object that was sited.  Filtering first on 'triangle' in the Shape field will return a list of all sighting that were described to have that shape.  Then the user could filter by area to see the prevelence of triangle shape sighting in California for example.

To clear the filters and start again the user can either delete their entries and click anywhere on the page or click the title "UFO Sightings" and/or refresh button.  If only 1 filter has been set they can simply replace the field with new criteria.

## Summary
The functionality of the UFO Project webpage is working as expected.  It looks great! It allows interactive filtering on the UFO Sightings data through input in mutiple filter fields.

### Drawback?
One drawback of the design is the overall page layout.  Putting the filters at the left hand side of the page will cause the user to have to scroll down often.  Also this limits the space for the information fields.  The comments field, depending on the size of the page is very limited causing a long vertical with alot of text wrapping.   If the Filter Search fields were put across the entire page width, this would eliminate unnecessary scrolling and would give more room for the Comments field text.

### Recommendations:
For further development opportunities I would recommend the following:

* Error or N/A message.  Currently when inforamtion is entered in a filter field that is not available in the data there is no indicator of that.  There is no message saying that 'there are no results for this criteria', nor is there a 'no data found' message to reassure the user that the filter is working find but just didn't find any matching data.

* Text search: There is a lot of information in the Comments field.  It would be advantagous to add a text search in the comments field.   This would greatly increase the usability of the filters.  For example several times in the comments the speak about sightings on or near News Years Eve.  A text search would allow a more free form search of this extra data.





In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.
