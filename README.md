## Overview of Project   Explain the purpose of this analysis.
The JavaScript and UFOs project is designed to illustrate the use of a multi-filtered table rendering data retrieved fromthe the ???? website.  This table will allow mutiple variables to be entered in the filter such as City, State and even the Shape of the UFO!!!  This project was also an exploration into the power of JavaScript and HTML in making a user friendly, interactive webpage.  

The UFO sitings data that was used for this project is from 2010 and reaches across the United States and Canada.

## Results
The results were multifold ... firstly one result was a great looking webpage!!

On this site at the beginning a full set of data is available.  To make the data more user friendly 5 Filters are provided un the 'Filter Search' title.  The filters include:
* Date
* City
* State/Province
* Country
* Shape

### How it Works.
The user can enter any viable entry into any field.  For example if 'ca' is entered into the state field.  A fill list of sitings in that state of California.

To drill down further a city filter could be added.  Dana may notice that el cajon is listeded several times.  Entering 'el cajon' into the City filter will return all of the sitings in El Cajon, California

If the user wanted to understand the prevelence of a specific type of UFO the say want to start their filtering on the Shape of the object that was sited.  Filtering first on 'triangle' in the Shape field will return a list of all siting that were described to have that shape.  Then the user could filter by area to see the prevelence of triangle shape siting in California for example.



Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.

## Summary





In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.
